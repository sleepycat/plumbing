# Plumbing

This is a yet another boilerplate project. The goal is a TDD oriented
minimalistic starting point with React and Jest.

I'm compiling both front and backend with Webpack to simplify the build step.
There is currently no HMR happening, but that's intentional since the goal is
to let the tests drive the development rather than looking at the interface.

The bigger boundary here is to get the various pieces of the React/Facebook
stack working quickly, so GraphQL is likely to end up in here and possibily
Flowtype.
